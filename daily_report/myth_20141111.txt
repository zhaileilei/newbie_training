					DIARY
    Today is Tuesday, the weather is sunny to cloudy. What a nice day! I 
hope it will keep fine.
    You make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day your
order takes out and it changes your life. ã€€If you always put limit one verything
you do, physical or anything else. It will spread into your workand into your
life. There are no limits. There are only plateaus, and you must not stay there,
you must go beyond them. If you have a dream, you mustuse all the way to achieve
it! I believe that it can bring sucess! Come on!
