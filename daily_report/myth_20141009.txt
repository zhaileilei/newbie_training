				DIARY
    Today is Thursday, the weather is sunny to cloudy. Today is a new day, 
and the new life. 
    Today I still as usual came to the company. And then began to enter 
into the working state. To start learning related content. After an hour,
I received notice from the company. We will carry out the new content that
course training tomorrow. So I'm working time will be a little more, then 
I need to re arrange the learning plan. Anyway, the most important task is 
to learn. I hope everything will go smoothly. Come on!
