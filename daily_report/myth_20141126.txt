					DIARY
    Today is Wednesday, the weather is sunny to cloudy. What a nice day! 
I like this day!
	Making a little progress per day,harvesting per day, accumulating 
little by little, achieving the dream in my heart. I get something new every
day. Although every day harvest is not great, but I believe that a long time, 
the harvest must be good! So we need to keep learning, to learn new knowledge.
I believe that in the near future, you will be sucessfulÔºÅ Come on!
