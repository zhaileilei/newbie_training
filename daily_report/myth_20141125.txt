				DIARY
    Today is Tuesday, the weather is light rain changing to cloudy. Iâ€™m so 
sorry it has turned out wet.
    Henceforth, I will learn and apply another secret of those who excel in
my work. When each day is ended, not regarding whether it has been a success
or a failure, I will attempt to achieve one more sale. When my thoughts 
beckon my tired body homeward I will resist the temptation to depart. I will
try again. I will make one more attempt to close with victory, and if that 
fails I will make another. Never will I allow any day to end with a failure.
Thus will I plant the seed of tomorrow's success and gain an insurmountable
advantage over those who cease their labor at a prescribed time. When 
others cease their struggle, the mine will begin, and my harvest will be full.
