					DIARY
    Today is Thursday, the weather is sunny. The weather today is as 
different again from what it was yesterday. I hope everday like this.
    Different people have different views on success. Some hold that making
a great deal of money means  success. Others argue that holding an important 
post in the government means success. Still others believe that having a 
high academic title at a famous university or a research institute means 
success.  
    In my opinion, success means brilliant achievement in our work. In other
words, no matter what we do, making outstanding contributions to the development
of our country and bringing help and happiness to others is success.
