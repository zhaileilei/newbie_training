					DIARY
    Today is Monday, the weather is sunny to cloudy. What a fine day! I hope
everyday like this.
    I don't know why the traffic of today is so bad! Today I am almost late.
With the developing of the ecnomic, the traffic condictions in some big 
cities is becoming more and more worse, especially in the rush hour. People 
waste a lot of time in waiting the bus or in their way home. It's time the 
government take measures to improve the traffic conditiongs. 
    In a word, I believe that we can improve our traffic condictions if we 
try our best.
