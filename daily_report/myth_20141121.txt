				DIARY
    Today is Friday, the weather is sunny to cloudy. What a nice day! I 
believe that life is woderful!
    Learning is one of the most important things in oneâ€™s life. Although 
we have studied something for many years, and have learned a lot already, 
there are still some experiences and laws summed up or discovered by our 
predecessors for us to learn. Moreover, the world keeps changing unceasingly.
There is always something new for them to learn. Thus, we must be aware that 
we should stick to learning throughout our lives. Constant learning can make 
people become more learned and experienced so that we can suit the changing
world better.
