				DIARY
    Today is Tuesday, the weather is sunny. The air is warm and there are
little white clouds high in the blue sky.
    The secret of success (The key to success) is not so much money as a 
strong will. A great man is one who has a strong will and an indomitable 
spirit. In other words, if a man does not have a strong will to win (get) 
the final victory, he will never succeed in his life. He is no more than a 
failure. It is quite obvious that there is no difficult thing (nothing difficult)
in the world. if you make up your mind to do it, you will certainly accomplish
your end. That stands to reason.
