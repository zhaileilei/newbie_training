				MY DIARY
    Today is Thursday, the weather is sunny to cloudy.Today is still as 
usual came to the office on time.
    Came after the company, found that yesterday's program there is little
question. The final output will always appear error message. So I opened 
my write function, and then to look for problems. But I took half a day, or 
not found error. So I surf the Internet search related issues, and then to 
find the right answer. Then I finally found the problem, I read function 
condition judgment made a mistake. So I have modified the program, and 
then compile, finally found the output correctly. This is also a small 
harvest! Come on!
