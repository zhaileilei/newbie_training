					DIARY
    Today is Wednesday, the weather is sunny to cloudy. What a nice day!
I like this weather. 
    The computer is really widely used in the world．We have entered the 
21st century．The 21st century will undoubtedly be a century of information
technology. As you know，computers are really widely used nowadays，all 
over the world．People use it to do business，they use it to make friends，
and they use it to chat on the net，to play video games，to store all those
important files and writings，and do all sorts of things．But because my 
computer point out a problem, So I need to mend it. It took 2 hours times.
Finally, I fixed it.
