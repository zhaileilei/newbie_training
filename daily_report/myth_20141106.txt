				DIARY
    Today is Thursday, the weather is sunny. What a lovely day! I hope the 
weather stays this way.
    Action is the proper fruit of knowledge. Whatever a manâ€™s status is (may be),
he must have an aim. If not, he can hardly stand on his own two feet in the world.
That stands to reason.However important fame and wealth may be, we must not let
them become our object in life. We should aim at doing something useful to the 
society.If my aim can come true, I hope (wish) to be a teacher. However, teaching 
is by no means an easy thing. I must apply myself closely to my studies so as to be
able to cope with my duties (as a teacher).
