			     MY DIART
    Today is Monday, the weather is sunny to cloudy. Today is a new week, 
and is also a new day. Of course, we are about to enter the busy work.
    Today came after the company is still the same as before, continue to 
learn new knowledge. First understand the relevant knowledge, careful to 
read the content. What do not understand to check information, And then 
slowly to understand it. If I still don't understand, and then to ask my
colleagues. I hope they can help me to solve related problems. There are 
many ways to study, but the results have only one. Is I want to understand 
it. Come on!
