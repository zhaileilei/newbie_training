				DIARY
    Today is Monday, the weather is sunny to cloudy. Time passed very 
quickly, the holiday is over. It means that today I begin to work.
    Today after I came to the company, continue to learn jiffies. Since my 
last month did not complete the task, so I need to learn it.  Because I 
knew that jiffies is not very familiar with, so when I wrote the program 
will be relatively slow. So I carefully look at the books, to understand 
it. What do not understand I'll check information. After a day's hard work
 I finally completed the task.
