				DIARY
    Today is Tuesday, the weather is sunny to cloudy. I don't know why I 
feel uncomfortable? I hope everthing is become ok!
    What makes life worth living? There are many possible answers to this 
question such as "good health","a comfortable home", “plenty of friends"or"
long holidays”. But these things would not make life worth living, unless 
we were able to enjoy them. Whether or not we can enjoy these things 
depends on the emotions.  If it is a bad feeling, then you will know to 
keep away from situation like that in the future. If it is a good feeling,
then you will know what will give you more good feeling. So I like this way.
