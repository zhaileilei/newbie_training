    Today is Thursday, the weather is sunny to cloudy. What a lovely day
it is. I hope it will keep fine.
    Stress is an inevitable part in our normal life. Many kinds of things, 
such as natural disasters, war and death can cause too much stress in our 
life. But according to a psychologist, on a day-to-day basis, stress may 
result from the small things: taking an exam, waiting in line, and having 
too many things to do in a limited time. 
    When stress does occur, it's important to recognize and deal with it.
So we need to find ways to relieve stress that can change our life.
