					DIARY
    Today is Tuesday, the weather is sunny to cloudy. These two days the 
weather seems good, my heart is very sweet.
    Today I came to the company, begin to review previously learned content.
There are some learning content, is not very good, I want to review the 
good now. So I read books on related knowledge, and then began to write 
program. If I meet a problem when writing a program, so I continue to 
modify the code, until success! There is only one goal, is to understand 
the program. Come on!
