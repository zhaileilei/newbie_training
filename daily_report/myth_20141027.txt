				DIARY
    Today is Monday, the weather is sunny to cloudy. Today the weather was 
cool, so I need to put on more clothes. 
    Today after I came to the company, I started learning Android. I know 
my foundation is relatively poor, so I need to study hard. When I study, 
If I encounter some problems can be not solved., I will seek the help of 
colleagues. I hope they can help me solve the problem. But, I also need to
learn how to learn, to find the ways of learning. After a day of learning, 
I found some problems not yet solved, but I believe the future will be better.
