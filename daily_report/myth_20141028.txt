				DIARY
    Today is Tuesday, the weather is sunny to cloudy. Today I found time 
was a cruel thing. Whatever man is, time always goes on. It won’t stay to 
wait for somebody.
    Today after I came to the company, I began to seriously deal with time.
So I work harder, because the time is really very important. You can’t use 
anything to exchange time. Time is also a fair thing. Although you have a 
lot of money or you enjoy high reputation, time won’t leave them more. So I
found I had a lot of things to do. I also hope that all people can cherish 
time, cherish life. Every day is a new day. Come on!
