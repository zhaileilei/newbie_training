					DIARY
    Today is Wednesday, the weather is sunny. This morning I got up as 
usual, but the traffic and not the same as usual. The traffic is heavy 
today.
    Today I was on time to the company. Came after the company, I began to 
learn the list. To tell you the truth, The list is a bit strange to me.
Because the list I wrote the program is less, so I'm using time more 
difficult. So the more time I spend. How is whatever I want to learn it.
If I am in trouble when the problem, don't understand to ask colleagues.
I hope they can help me. thank you!
