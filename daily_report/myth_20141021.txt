						DIARY
	Today is Tuesday, the weather is overcast to cloudy. I got up early 
this morning, so I came to the company early.
	Today after I came to the company, I open my computer. And then  I 
start to listen to yesterday's courses. Because the time is coming, so 
today I must take time to complete the course of training. So today I 
listen very carefully. In the afternoon, I begin to review my program.
Because, I still have some problems do not quite understand, so I need to 
study hard.
