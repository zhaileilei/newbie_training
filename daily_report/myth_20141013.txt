					DIARY
    Today is Monday, the weather is sunny to cloudy. Time passed very 
quickly. This morning I got up later, found the weather gets a little
cold. So I wear more clothes.
    Today after I came to the company, to begin to work. At first I 
reviewed last week's content. Because last week I learn content is not
very good. So I need to work hard to understand it. So I repeated the 
test my program. Then to observe the test phenomenon. In the afternoon, 
I began to learn  new employees training course. The course was one 
afternoon. When I finished the course, continue to go back to work.
