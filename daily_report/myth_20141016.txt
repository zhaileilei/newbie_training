					DIARY
    Today is Thursday, the weather is sunny to cloudy. Today the weather 
seems to be a little warmer. So today, my clothes will wear a little less.
    Today after I came to the company, begin to review knowledge of 
yesterday. I wrote a sorting program yesterday, but the results are not 
ideal. So I'm constantly try to improve it,  I hope  can debug better.
Finally I found the results a little better than before. After I have 
written procedures, to start learning android. This thing is more complex,
first of all need to configure the environment variables. So today's slow 
progress. but I still have the harvest.
