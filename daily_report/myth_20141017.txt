					DIARY
    Today is Friday, the weather is sunny to cloudy. Tomorrow is the 
weekend, time passed very quickly.
    Today after I came to the company, to start doing my courseware. Because
the last time I did not do a good job in the courseware, so need to improve.
So I surf the Internet Baidu access to relevant information. Hope I can do 
better. I spent about a morning time to revise and design, finally found a 
bit small achievements. In the afternoon, I went to take part in training 
about new people. Today it is so over.
