							DIARY
    Today is Wednesday, the weather is sunny to cloudy. Today the weather
is good, So I was in a good mood.
    Every day is a new day. So today is also a new beginning. Today after I 
came to the company, started to learn new knowledge. I wrote some of the 
sort program, But on the optimization of I consider less. So today I need 
to study the optimization process. Improve the running efficiency of the 
program. I have consulted a number of relevant data, modify the program, 
can do for more perfect. I made a continuous test, Finally, I found a 
little small success.
