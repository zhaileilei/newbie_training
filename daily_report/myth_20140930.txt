					MY DIARY
    Today is Tuesday, the weather is sunny to cloudy. Time off really fast,
Tomorrow is National Day.
    Arrived in the company, found that everyone is working very hard. 
Looks like National Day vacation did not affect everyone's work enthusiasm.
I also like other people, also began to enter the busy learning. Today I
learn is timer. To understand the timing and delay of its tasks. At first 
I carefully to read a book on the content, Let me know how it works? And 
then to write the corresponding program to achieve the corresponding functions. 
Through the efforts of today, not finished it. But I believe I can do next. 
Come on!
