				DIARY
    Today is Monday, the weather is rain changing to light rain. Terrible 
weather, isn't it? 
    The weather was so bad today as well as my mood. I found some professional
knowledge to learn a bit of trouble today, I was so upset, because I had try 
my best and spent a lot of time doing exercise. To make things worse, it started
to rain when the class is over.
    I stared at the gray sky, wondering whether I should to run in the rain.
Suddenly, someone patted my shoulder. I turned back immediately and find it was my
best friend.saying nothing. He give me his umbrella with a smile. I felt so moved 
and warm.
