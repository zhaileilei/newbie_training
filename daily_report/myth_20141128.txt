				DIARY
    Today is Friday, the weather is cloudy. It looks as if itâ€™s going to 
rain. It seems that the weather will  become a little cold.
    We can't have good luck forever, so learning how to face difficulities 
is important. Some people feel upset when they meet difficulities,and they 
don't want to try to let their dreams come ture anymore. I think if you can
have a good psychology when you meet difficulities in your life,and be more
confident and brave, try to find a good way to relax, maybe talk to others 
or have a rest, and then think it over, make a plan to solve your problems.
If you do so, you'll find that your difficulities are not as difficult as 
you think before!
