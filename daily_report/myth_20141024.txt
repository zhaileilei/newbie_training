				DIARY
    Today is Friday, the weather is sunny to cloudy. This is the fifth 
working days of the week. Tomorrow is weekend.
    Today after I came to the company, continue to work hard. Today I 
found a truth. Both work and play are necessary to us; the former gives us 
knowledge while the latter (gives) rest. An English proverb is well said: 
“Work while you work play while you play.” It makes our life pleasant, 
efficient and successful. Work is one thing and play is another. It is of 
course not good to work all day long. However, it is also not good to play
all day long. While you work, you should work in earnest. Then while you 
play, you will feel more relaxed and pleasant. That goes without saying.
