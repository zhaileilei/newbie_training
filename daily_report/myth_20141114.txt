				DIARY
    Today is Thursday, the weather is sunny to cloudy. What a nice day! I 
hope it will keep fine.
    Study English,You do need to use English with speakers who are not 
teachers of English. This isnï¼‡t easy, since everyone feels constrained 
speaking English with friends with whom it would be natural to use a shared
mother tongue. Joining an English Club is a good idea and joining a club 
with an international membership (where English is in use at least some of 
the time) is, for many people, even better. If nothing like this is 
accessible, you might consider what would be involved in getting something 
going.
