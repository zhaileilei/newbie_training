				DIARY
    Today is Friday, the weather is sunny to cloudy. Today, the weather
is seems to be a little cold!
    Work and play do not contradict each other; in fact， they complement 
each other。 As the saying goes， "All work and no play makes Jack a dull 
boy. " A life burdened with work leads you nowhere， for you would get 
tired and bored with your daily routine work. On the other hand， proper 
recreation will relieve the tension and discomfort of our monotonous life 
because it offers you various ways to let out your pent－up emotions. We 
should learn to work and rest!
