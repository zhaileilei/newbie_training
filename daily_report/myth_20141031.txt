			 DIARY
    Today is Friday, the weather is moderate rain to light rain. Because of
the weather is not good, so the traffic is very bad.
    As time goes on, I came to the company has nearly two months. I found 
a extremely important thing. As is well known, books teach us to learn life, 
truth, science and many other useful things. They increase our knowledge, 
broaden our minds and strengthen our character. In other words, they are 
our good teachers and wise friends. This is the reason why our parents 
always encourage us to read more books. So, I'm extremely fond of book. 
Come on!
