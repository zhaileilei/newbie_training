				MY DIARY
    Today is Friday, the weather rain turned cloudy. Although the weather is 
bad, but I still go to work on time. 
    Came into the company, I have to recompile the program yesterday, to see 
if normal running. When I use load command module loading, everything is ok.
But I use to check the order when test equipment to read and write to the 
problem. This kind of situation I was also not met, then the Internet query 
related issues. Online comments that may be you don't have to set the 
permissions on the files related problems. Then I set the permissions to 
777. After test again, found reading and writing are successful. Feel good.
