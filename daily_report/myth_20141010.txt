				DIARY
    Today is Friday, the weather is sunny to cloudy. It's a nice day today.
So I feel a little better. 
    After I came to the company, I started reading a two hour programã€‚
Then I went to the company to arrange the new training class. Let us new 
employees understand the enterprise culture and the system of the company.
We need to listen carefully. because after course ends,	We need to test.
So when the teacher lectures, we were all very quiet. Today, we listen to 
the lecture, about half a day. After class, I went back to work.
