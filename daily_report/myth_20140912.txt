                              MY DIARY
    Today is Friday, the weather overcast drizzle. Woke up today than the 
previous two days a little bit early, but they still take the time to get 
ready for work, came to the company opened yesterday to the notes and Book 
review.
    To this day I know my own professional knowledge to mastery is relatively
poor, need oneself to make great efforts to mend, I first look at the Makefile,
there are many aspects to grasp not good.Later found their own Linux system 
problems, their source can't update was found, resulting in theinput method
and some other than software installed does not come out, I pondered for a 
long time, search the Internet, through a variety of ways to realize it, but
they all failed. Then the network and his colleagues reminded me, or change 
to a Linux system, to find a stable. Just don't do itmyself installed, and then
learning, finally installed.Have a little sense of achievement, hope that their
 continued efforts. Come on!
